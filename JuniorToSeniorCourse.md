### Performance Tools
1. [View main thread activities in a table](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#activities) to sort activities based on which ones took up the most time.
2. [Analyze frames per second (FPS)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#fps) to measure whether your animations truly run smoothly.
3. [Monitor CPU usage, JS heap size, DOM nodes, layouts per second, and more](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-64/#perf-monitor) in real-time with the Performance Monitor.
4. [Capture screenshots while recording](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#screenshots) to play back exactly how the page looked while the page loaded, or an animation fired, and so on.
5. [View interactions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#interactions) to quickly identify what happened on a page after a user interacted with it.
6. [Find scroll performance issues in real-time](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#scrolling-performance-issues) by highlighting the page whenever a potentially problematic listener fires.
7. [View paint events in real-time](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#paint-flashing) to identify costly paint events that may be harming the performance of your animations.
8. [View main thread activity](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#main) to view every event that occurred on the main thread while you were recording.

### Additional image manipulation tools
- [XNConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/): This free, cross-platform tool can handle batched images, and performs resizing, optimization, and other transforms.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac): This free tool is available for Mac and as an online service, and is specifically aimed at optimizing images for speed, including metadata removal (discussed above).
- [ResizeIt](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resizeit/id416280139?mt=12): A Mac-only desktop product that lets you change the size of multiple images simultaneously, and can convert file formats at the same time.
- [PicResize](https://picresize.com/): One of several good browser-based tools that gives you lots of options for cropping, rotating, resizing, adding effects to, and converting images.
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/): This ever-popular cross-platform tool just gets better with age. Powerful and flexible, Gimp lets you perform a wide variety of image manipulation tasks including, of course, resizing.
